    # encoded percent sign (%25) or backslash (%5C) in the URL
    # If you are sure, that your webapp doesn't use such
    # URLs, enable the option to prevent double encoding attacks.

    # in request URLs before looking for mount or unmount
    # matches.
    # Since: 1.2.41

    # After setting JkStripSession to "On", mod_jk will
    # strip all ";jsessionid=..." from request URLs it
    # does *not* forward to a backend.
    # This is useful, if all links in a webapp use
    # URLencoded session IDs and parts of the static
    # content should be delivered directly by Apache.
    # Of course you can also do it with mod_rewrite.
    # Since: 1.2.21

    # Example for Mounting a context to the worker "balancer"
    # The URL syntax "a|b" instantiates two mounts at once,
    # the first one is "a", the second one is "ab".
    # JkMount /myapp|/* balancer

    # Example for UnMounting requests for all workers
    # using a simple URL pattern
    # Since: 1.2.26
    # JkUnMount /myapp/static/* *

    # Example for UnMounting requests for a named worker
    # JkUnMount /myapp/images/* balancer

    # Example for UnMounting requests using regexps
    # SetEnvIf REQUEST_URI "\.(htm|html|css|gif|jpg|js)$" no-jk

    # Example for setting a reply timeout depending on the request URL
    # Since: 1.2.27
    # SetEnvIf Request_URI "/transactions/" JK_REPLY_TIMEOUT=600000

    # Example for disabling reply timeouts for certain request URLs
    # Since: 1.2.27
    # SetEnvIf Request_URI "/reports/" JK_REPLY_TIMEOUT=0

    # IMPORTANT: Mounts and virtual hosts
    # If you are using VirtualHost elements, you
    # - can put mounts only used in some virtual host into its VirtualHost element
    # - can copy all global mounts to it using "JkMountCopy On" inside the VirtualHost
    # - can copy all global mounts to all virtual hosts by putting
    #   "JkMountCopy All" into the global server
    # Since: 1.2.26
